# Security Notice - Implementation Details Removed

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Action**: Removal of proprietary implementation details  
**Reason**: Patent protection (US 63/902,536) and trade secret preservation

---

## What Was Removed

The following files and directories have been removed from public tracking to protect intellectual property:

### **Implementation Code**
- `montecarlo/` - Complete Monte Carlo calibration implementation
- `code/calibrate_anchor_tensors.py` - Proprietary calibration algorithms
- `code/phase_c_integration.py` - Integration algorithms
- `code/achieve_100pct_resolution.py` - Resolution algorithms
- `code/test_concordance_empirical.py` - Testing implementations
- `tests/dissect_merge_calculation.py` - Merge algorithm tests

### **Documentation with Formulas**
- `SESSION_MEMORY.md` - Development session notes
- `mathuscript_hubble_tension.md` - Mathematical descriptions
- `EVIDENCE_PACKAGE_FOR_MANUSCRIPT.md` - Complete evidence package
- `manuscript_hubble_tension_resolution.tex` - LaTeX manuscript drafts
- `SAID_CORRECTION_LOG.md` - Correction logs

---

## What Remains Public

### **Safe for Public Access**:
- ✅ Data files and datasets (published measurements)
- ✅ Results and validation outputs
- ✅ Non-implementation code (data processing, visualization)
- ✅ General documentation
- ✅ Citations and references

## For Researchers

If you're interested in reproducing the Hubble tension resolution results:

1. **Published Papers**: See references in README.md
2. **Data**: All input data is from published sources (see `data/` directory)
3. **Results**: Validation results available in `results/` directory

For access to implementation details or licensing inquiries:
- **Email**: eric.martin1@wsu.edu
- **Patent**: US Provisional 63/902,536
- **Owner**: All Your Baseline LLC

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository now serves as:
- **Data Archive**: Published input measurements
- **Results Repository**: Validation outputs and figures
- **Documentation**: General methodology (without implementation details)

**Implementation details are protected by patent and trade secret and available only through licensing.**
