EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This work quantifies anchor-dependent systematic structure in the SH0ES Cepheid
distance ladder and develops a data-driven framework for combining measurements
from different epistemic domains.

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
1. Anchor choice contributes 51.9% ± 0.8% of total SH0ES variance
2. Systematic spread between anchors: 3.90 km/s/Mpc
3. Observer Domain Tensors quantify epistemic distance between methodologies
4. Conservative N/U merge with systematic_fraction correction gives:
   
   Merged H₀ = 67.57 ± 0.93 km/s/Mpc

5. This is compatible with Planck (67.40 ± 0.50) within 0.18σ

IMPORTANT CAVEAT:
-----------------
While the merged value is close to Planck's CMB measurement, this does NOT
"resolve the Hubble tension" because:
  • All three SH0ES anchors remain individually >9σ discrepant with Planck
  • The merge is dominated by Planck's smaller uncertainty (37:1 weight ratio)
  • Fundamental early-late time discrepancy persists

CONTRIBUTION:
-------------
We provide a rigorous framework for characterizing epistemic structure in
multi-methodology measurements and a data-driven correction (systematic_fraction)
to avoid double-counting variance already captured in measured uncertainties.

RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

ANCHOR VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION:
-------------------------------
Using 210 systematic measurements from Riess+ 2016 (VizieR J/ApJ/826/56):

   NGC4258 (megamaser):     72.52 ± 2.39 km/s/Mpc (n=70)
   Milky Way (parallax):    76.17 ± 2.34 km/s/Mpc (n=70)
   LMC (binaries):          72.27 ± 2.62 km/s/Mpc (n=70)
   
   Spread: 3.90 km/s/Mpc
   Anchor variance: 4.78 (km/s/Mpc)²
   Total variance:  9.21 (km/s/Mpc)²
   
   Anchor contribution: 51.9% ± 0.8% (bootstrap validated)

CROSS-VALIDATION:
-----------------
Eigenspectrum decomposition of 210×210 empirical covariance matrix shows
top mode contributes 49.4% of variance, independently confirming the ~50%
anchor contribution.

OBSERVER DOMAIN TENSORS:
-------------------------
Epistemic distances from CMB reference frame:

   NGC4258:  |T| = 0.518 (dominated by Ω_m offset: +14.9%)
   Milky Way: |T| = 0.545 (dominated by Ω_m offset: +24.6%)
   LMC:      |T| = 0.517 (dominated by Ω_m offset: +14.4%)
   
   Average: Δ_T = 0.527

SYSTEMATIC_FRACTION CORRECTION:
--------------------------------
Key innovation: Reduce epistemic penalty by the fraction of variance already
captured in the data to avoid double-counting.

   systematic_fraction = 0.519 (from variance decomposition)
   
   Epistemic penalty = (disagreement / 2) × Δ_T × (1 - systematic_fraction)
                     = (6.24 / 2) × 0.527 × 0.481
                     = 0.79 km/s/Mpc

This is 7.2× larger than naive tuning would suggest, demonstrating the
importance of data-driven corrections.

N/U CONSERVATIVE MERGE:
-----------------------
Before merge:
   Planck (CMB, early-time):    67.40 ± 0.50 km/s/Mpc
   SH0ES (weighted, late-time): 73.64 ± 3.03 km/s/Mpc
   Disagreement:                6.24 km/s/Mpc (2.0σ)

After merge:
   Merged H₀:                   67.57 ± 0.93 km/s/Mpc
   Offset from Planck:          0.17 km/s/Mpc (0.18σ)
   
   Merged interval:  [66.64, 68.50] km/s/Mpc
   Planck interval:  [66.90, 67.90] km/s/Mpc
   Compatible: YES ✓

UNCERTAINTY COMPONENTS:
-----------------------
   Base (inverse-variance): 0.49 km/s/Mpc
   Epistemic penalty:       0.79 km/s/Mpc (systematic_fraction corrected)
   Total (quadrature):      0.93 km/s/Mpc
   
   Epistemic contribution: 46% of total uncertainty

The merged uncertainty is 1.9× larger than naive inverse-variance weighting,
reflecting genuine epistemic distance between measurement domains.

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

PHASE A: Published Aggregate (Baseline)
----------------------------------------
Method:
  • Used published aggregate H₀ values
  • Simple N/U merge without epistemic corrections
  • Bootstrap validation (10,000 samples)

Result:
  • 91.1% gap reduction (5.40 → 0.48 km/s/Mpc)
  • Demonstrated framework viability
  • Limited by aggregate uncertainties

Status: ✅ VALIDATED (conservative baseline)

PHASE C: Empirical Covariance
------------------------------
Method:
  • Extracted 210×210 covariance from VizieR systematic grid
  • Per-anchor analysis with full correlations
  • Eigenspectrum decomposition
  • Monte Carlo validation

Results:
  • Per-anchor reductions: 45-71% (conservative)
  • Empirical σ_sys = 2.17 km/s/Mpc (vs published 0.80)
  • Top eigenmode: 49.4% (anchor choice dominates)
  • 6 publication figures generated

Status: ✅ EMPIRICAL (anchor spread quantified)

PHASE D: Full Posterior with Systematic_Fraction
-------------------------------------------------
Method:
  • Generated 15,000 MCMC samples from empirical covariance
  • Observer-tensor weighted combination (inverse epistemic distance)
  • Computed systematic_fraction from variance decomposition
  • Applied corrected epistemic penalty formula
  • N/U conservative uncertainty propagation

Key Formula (CORRECTED):
  ```
  systematic_fraction = anchor_variance / total_variance
  epistemic_penalty = (disagreement / 2) × Δ_T × (1 - systematic_fraction)
  σ_merged = √(σ_base² + epistemic_penalty²)
  ```

Result:
  • Merged H₀ = 67.57 ± 0.93 km/s/Mpc
  • systematic_fraction = 0.519 (data-driven)
  • Epistemic penalty = 0.79 km/s/Mpc
  • Compatible with Planck within 0.18σ

Status: ✅ CORRECTED (see SAID_CORRECTION_LOG.md)

================================================================================
CRITICAL ANALYSIS: WHY THIS IS NOT "RESOLUTION"
================================================================================

THE WEIGHT RATIO ISSUE:
------------------------
Inverse-variance weighting gives:
  • Planck weight: 4.00 (σ = 0.50)
  • SH0ES weight:  0.11 (σ = 3.03)
  • Ratio: 36.7:1
  
Planck contributes 97.3% of the merged value.

IMPLICATION:
The merged result (67.57) is essentially Planck (67.40) + 2.7% SH0ES.
This is a weighted average, not a resolution of the underlying tension.

THE INDIVIDUAL ANCHOR TENSIONS:
--------------------------------
All three anchors remain highly discrepant with Planck:
  
  NGC4258 - Planck:  72.52 - 67.40 = 5.12 km/s/Mpc (10.2σ)
  MW - Planck:       76.17 - 67.40 = 8.77 km/s/Mpc (17.5σ)
  LMC - Planck:      72.27 - 67.40 = 4.87 km/s/Mpc (9.7σ)

IMPLICATION:
The fundamental early-late time discrepancy persists. Our framework characterizes
the systematic structure but does not explain it away.

WHAT THE FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY DOES:
----------------------------------
1. Quantifies anchor-dependent systematic structure (51.9%)
2. Weights measurements by inverse epistemic distance
3. Reduces penalty by variance already captured (systematic_fraction)
4. Propagates uncertainty conservatively (N/U algebra)

This is valuable for characterizing multi-methodology measurements, but it is
NOT evidence that the tension is "resolved" or that "no new physics is required."

================================================================================
HONEST SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS
================================================================================

✅ CLAIM 1: Anchor systematics contribute 51.9% ± 0.8% of SH0ES variance

Evidence:
  • Variance decomposition: σ²_anchor / σ²_total = 4.78 / 9.21
  • Bootstrap validation: 51.9% ± 0.8% (CI: [50.3%, 53.6%])
  • Eigenspectrum cross-check: 49.4% (top mode)

Strength: STRONG (independently validated)

✅ CLAIM 2: Anchor spread (3.90 km/s/Mpc) larger than published uncertainty

Evidence:
  • Published combined: 73.24 ± 0.80 km/s/Mpc
  • Observed spread: 76.17 - 72.27 = 3.90 km/s/Mpc
  • Ratio: 4.9× larger
  • Empirical σ_sys = 2.17 km/s/Mpc (2.7× published)

Strength: STRONG (directly measured from data)

✅ CLAIM 3: Observer Domain Tensors quantify epistemic distance

Evidence:
  • Δ_T dominated by Ω_m offset component (14-25%)
  • Physical interpretation: Different cosmological contexts
  • Inverse-distance weighting produces data-driven combination

Strength: MODERATE (framework-dependent interpretation)

✅ CLAIM 4: systematic_fraction correction is data-driven

Evidence:
  • Computed from variance decomposition (not tuned)
  • Avoids double-counting variance already in σ_total
  • Epistemic penalty = 0.79 km/s/Mpc (vs naive ~0.11)

Strength: STRONG (directly calculated from data)

✅ CLAIM 5: N/U merge gives conservative uncertainty propagation

Evidence:
  • Merged σ (0.93) > naive σ (0.49) by factor 1.9×
  • Epistemic penalty contributes 46% of total uncertainty
  • Larger uncertainty more honest about epistemic distance

Strength: STRONG (demonstrable from calculation)

❌ CANNOT CLAIM: "Resolved the Hubble tension"

Reasons:
  • All anchors individually >9σ from Planck
  • Merge dominated by 37:1 weight ratio favoring Planck
  • Fundamental early-late time discrepancy persists
  • Characterization ≠ explanation

❌ CANNOT CLAIM: "No new physics required"

Reasons:
  • We have not explained the >9σ anchor-CMB discrepancies
  • Our framework describes systematic structure, not physics
  • New physics remains viable (and possibly favored)

SAID FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

This work was produced in collaboration with Claude Code (Anthropic) following
the Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure (SAID) framework v1.3.3.

HUMAN CONTRIBUTIONS (Eric D. Martin):
-------------------------------------
  • Research direction and scientific objectives
  • Framework design (N/U Algebra, Observer Domain Tensors)
  • Insistence on rigorous falsification testing
  • Identification of implementation bug (missing systematic_fraction)
  • Scientific interpretation and claims assessment
  • Final verification of corrected results

AI CONTRIBUTIONS (Claude Code):
--------------------------------
  • Code implementation from specifications
  • Data processing and numerical computation
  • Execution of falsification test suite
  • Identification of discrepancy between documentation and code
  • Re-implementation with corrected formula
  • Generation of SAID correction log

ERROR DISCOVERED AND CORRECTED:
--------------------------------
During falsification testing, we discovered that the systematic_fraction
correction was documented but not properly implemented. See SAID_CORRECTION_LOG.md
for complete documentation of:
  • Original error (epistemic penalty underestimated by 7.2×)
  • Discovery process (falsification testing)
  • Correction (implemented data-driven systematic_fraction)
  • Impact (uncertainty 0.51 → 0.93 km/s/Mpc)
  • Lessons learned (documentation ≠ implementation)

This transparent error documentation demonstrates the value of SAID framework
for maintaining scientific integrity in AI-assisted research.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

WHAT WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED:
---------------------------
1. Anchor choice contributes 51.9% of SH0ES variance (rigorously validated)

2. Systematic spread (3.90 km/s/Mpc) is larger than published uncertainty,
   suggesting anchor-dependent systematics were underestimated

3. Observer Domain Tensors provide a framework for quantifying epistemic
   distance between measurement methodologies

4. The systematic_fraction correction enables data-driven reduction of
   epistemic penalty to avoid double-counting variance

5. Conservative N/U merge produces σ = 0.93 km/s/Mpc, properly accounting
   for epistemic distance (1.9× larger than naive merge)

WHAT WE HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED:
-------------------------------
1. We have NOT "resolved" the Hubble tension - all three SH0ES anchors
   remain >9σ discrepant with Planck

2. We have NOT shown that "no new physics is required" - the fundamental
   early-late time discrepancy persists

3. We have NOT explained WHY the anchors disagree with Planck - only
   characterized the systematic structure

SCIENTIFIC IMPACT:
------------------
This work provides:

✓ A rigorous quantification of anchor-dependent systematics
✓ A framework for combining multi-methodology measurements
✓ A data-driven correction (systematic_fraction) for epistemic penalties
✓ Transparent documentation of error discovery and correction (SAID)

These contributions are valuable for precision cosmology even though they do
not resolve the fundamental Hubble tension.

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
------------------
The Hubble tension remains. Our framework characterizes the systematic structure
in SH0ES measurements and provides a conservative approach to combining early
and late-time data, but it does not eliminate the >9σ discrepancies between
individual distance ladder anchors and CMB measurements.

New physics explanations (varying dark energy, modified gravity, early dark
energy, etc.) remain viable and possibly favored. Our work constrains the
role of anchor-dependent systematics but does not rule out fundamental physics
beyond ΛCDM.

This work demonstrates the value of rigorous falsification testing in
AI-assisted research. The implementation error was caught because the human
author insisted on testing despite apparently successful results, and the
AI assistant executed systematic checks that revealed the discrepancy.

The SAID framework enabled transparent documentation of both the error and
its correction, maintaining scientific integrity throughout the process.

FINAL STATEMENT
================================================================================

We have demonstrated that anchor-dependent systematics contribute 51.9% of
SH0ES H₀ variance and developed a rigorous framework for combining measurements
from different epistemic domains. The corrected N/U merge with systematic_fraction
correction yields 67.57 ± 0.93 km/s/Mpc, compatible with Planck CMB within 0.18σ.

However, this does NOT resolve the Hubble tension because all three distance
ladder anchors remain individually >9σ discrepant with Planck. Our framework
characterizes the systematic structure but does not explain the fundamental
early-late time discrepancy.

This work provides valuable tools for precision cosmology while maintaining
honest assessment of what has (and has not) been demonstrated.

The Hubble tension persists. New physics remains on the table.
