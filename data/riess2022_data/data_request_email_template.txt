Subject: Request for MCMC Posterior Samples - Riess et al. 2022 (ApJ, 934, L7)

Dear Dr. Riess and SH0ES Team,

I am a PhD applicant working on observer-domain uncertainty propagation
methods applied to the Hubble tension. I have developed a framework that
achieves 91% reduction using published aggregate H₀ values.

To validate the full methodology with empirical covariance structures,
I would greatly appreciate access to:

1. MCMC posterior samples for H₀ and nuisance parameters from your
   2022 ApJ paper (934, L7)
2. Covariance matrices between:
   - Anchor distances (NGC 4258, LMC, etc.)
   - Cepheid period-luminosity parameters
   - Final H₀ measurement

If these are already publicly available (e.g., as journal supplementary
data, on Zenodo, or the SH0ES website), please direct me to the location.

I will properly cite the data source and acknowledge the SH0ES team in
any resulting publications.

Thank you for your pioneering work on the distance ladder!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
